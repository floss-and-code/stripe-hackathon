# FLOSS and Code: Stripe hackathon
At GitHub, part of our vision is to impact positive and lasting change around the world through the products we help build.

In keeping with the spirit of our mission to accelerate human progress through developer collaboration, we have partnered with Stripe and Vercel (Next.js OSS team) to host a hackathon to help build e-commerce applications and tools to assist communities and businesses affected by Covid-19.

The hackathon will be hosted Tuesday, Dec 1 as a GitHub Universe Orbital event, and it is open to all GitHub users.

Agenda (All times are in PST)
- 9:30 am Welcome from GitHub
- 9:40 am Keynote speakers
- 10:45 Hackathon Q & A
- 11:30 Workshops (Stripe + Vercel)

## Attendee expectations
This event is open to programmers from all levels of experience. Individuals are expected to have a basic understanding of programming and the ability to contribute to projects using GitHub. For those interested in attending, but do not have that experience, they can take our [Introduction to GitHub course](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github).

## What is FLOSS?
Free/libre open-source software (FLOSS) is software that can be classified as both free software and open-source software. That is, anyone is freely licensed to use, copy, study, and change the software in any way, and the source code is openly shared so that people are encouraged to improve the design of the software voluntarily. This is in contrast to proprietary software, where the software is under restrictive copyright licensing, and the source code is usually hidden from the users.
